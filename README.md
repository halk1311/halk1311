#### Hi there ‚ú®

Worked as a technical interpreter but then decided to start from scratch. I am now on my way studing ML and feel extremely inspired about it!

#### Skills

Python, SQL, regexp, ML

Also a good command of English and great desire to learn

#### Education:

&nbsp;- Computer Linguistics, 2021-2022

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher School of Economics

&nbsp;- Linguistics and translation studies (English, German), 2015-2019

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherepovets State University

Moreover, now I keep learning and deepen my knowledge in graphs, Python etc. Mostly, I use Stepik, so, you can check out my achievements [there](https://stepik.org/users/49554936)

#### Experience

As a newbie I've only got my own projects so far üê£

Here they are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/halk1311/newborn/blob/main/titanic.ipynb) (hahaha, classic). It is the most recent thing I accomplished. The best result I achieved is 0.77511

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- [Computer Linguistics Final Project](https://github.com/halk1311/newborn/blob/main/Finals.ipynb). 
It involves building an ML model for classification of the text. The data I used were parsed, the code for data mining is [here](https://github.com/halk1311/newborn#:~:text=%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0_%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2.ipynb).
